        <p>My name is David, and I am a student learning the fundamentals of web development. I am
            interested
            in technology and enjoy learning how websites are built using HTML, CSS, and other web
            tools. This
            course is helping me develop practical skills that I can apply to future projects and
            career
            opportunities. I am excited to continue learning and improving my abilities throughout
            this class.</p>

            and strong entrepreneurial spirit. It is often called the “Giant of Africa” because of
            its large population and economic influence.</p>
